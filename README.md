## Introduction

This is an advanced Leisure Companion Application which is using Google Maps.

With geolocation, Google Maps API, place finder, location-based restaurant, hotel and attraction search from specialized Rapid APIs, data filtering and more, this app is, in my opinion, one of the best available today on the internet.
